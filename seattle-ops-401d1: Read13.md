# Cloud Architecture Security
## Intro to AWS VPC
> "A VPC (virtual private cloud) is a virtual data center in the cloud. You have complete control 
over your virtual networking environment, including a selection of your own private IP address range,
creation of subnets and configuration of route tables and network gateways." 

1. Subnets  
2. Route Tables  
3. Internet Gateways  
4. Network Address Translation  
5. Security groups  
6. Customer Gateway  
7. Virtual Private Gateway  
8. VPN stands for ‘virtual private networking’  
9. VPC Peering   
10. Network Access Control Lists (NACL)

## What is Amazon VPC?
> " Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network
that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in
your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS."

### Amazon VPC concepts
* Virtual private cloud (VPC) — A virtual network dedicated to your AWS account  
* Subnet — A range of IP addresses in your VPC.  
* Route table — A set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed  
* Internet gateway — A gateway that you attach to your VPC to enable communication between resources in your  
VPC and the internet  
* VPC endpoint — Enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services   
powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.
