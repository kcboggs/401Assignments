# The Pros & Cons of Intrusion Detection Systems

> "A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) can be an integral part of an organizationâ€™s security, but they are just one aspect of many in a cohesive and safe system."

## What Is an Intrusion Detection System?
_An intrusion detection system is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations._ 

## Intrusion Detection Systems vs. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
_IDS analyze network traffic for signatures that match known cyberattacks._
_IPS also analyzes packets, but can also stop the packet from being delivered based on what kind of attacks it detects_

# Network Intrusion Detection Systems vs. Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)
> "NIDS and an HIDS are complementary systems that differ by the position of the sensors: network-based (monitoring the ethernet or WiFi) and host-based, respectively. Because 
of this, their uses and deployment are quite different."

## Pros of Network Intrusion Detection Systems
* They Can Be Tuned to Specific Content in Network Packets  
* They Can Look at Data in the Context of the Protocol  
* They Can Qualify and Quantify Attacks  
* They Make It Easier to Keep Up With Regulation  
* They Can Boost Efficiency  

## Cons of Network Intrusion Detection Systems  
* They Will Not Prevent Incidents By Themselves  
* An Experienced Engineer Is Needed to Administer Them  
* They Do Not Process Encrypted Packets  
* IP Packets Can Still Be Faked  
* False Positives Are Frequent  
* They Are Susceptible to Protocol Based Attacks  
* The Signature Library Needs to Be Continually Updated to Detect the Latest Threats
