# Reconnaissance
### What is penetration testing
> " A simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities."

### Penetration testing stages
***Five Stages***
1. Planning and reconnaissance  
The first stage involves:
* Defining the scope and goals of a test, including the systems to be addressed and the testing methods to be used.  
* Gathering intelligence (e.g., network and domain names, mail server) to better understand how a target works and   
its potential vulnerabilities.  

2. Scanning  
This is typically done using:  
* Static analysis – Inspecting an application’s code to estimate the way it behaves while running. These tools can   
scan the entirety of the code in a single pass.  
* Dynamic analysis – Inspecting an application’s code in a running state. This is a more practical way of scanning,   
as it provides a real-time view into an application’s performance.  

3. Gaining Access
This stage uses web application attacks, such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection and backdoors, to uncover a target’s vulnerabilities. 
Testers then try and exploit these vulnerabilities, typically by escalating privileges, stealing data, intercepting traffic, etc., to understand the damage they can cause.

4. Maintaining access  
The goal of this stage is to see if the vulnerability can be used to achieve a persistent presence in the exploited system— long enough for  a bad actor to gain in-depth access. The idea is to imitate advanced persistent threats, which often remain in a system for months in order  to steal an organization’s most sensitive data.

5. Analysis  
***The results of the penetration test are then compiled into a report detailing:****
* Specific vulnerabilities that were exploited  
* Sensitive data that was accessed  
* The amount of time the pen tester was able to remain in the system undetected  

### Penetration testing methods
* External Testing  
* Internal Testing  
* Blind Testing  
* Double-blind Testing  
* Targeted Testing  

### Penetration testing and web application firewalls
***Penetration testing and WAFs are exclusive, yet mutually beneficial security measures.***

# An Introduction To Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Gathering
### OSINT types
1. The Internet, which includes the following and more: forums, blogs, social networking sites, video-sharing sites like YouTube.com, wikis, Whois records of registered domain names, metadata and digital files, dark web resources, geolocation data, IP addresses, people search engines, and anything that can be found online.  
2. Traditional mass media (e.g., television, radio, newspapers, books, magazines).  
3. Specialized journals, academic publications, dissertations, conference proceedings, company profiles, annual reports, company news, employee profiles, and résumés.  
4. Photos and videos including metadata    
5. Geospatial information (e.g., maps and commercial imagery products)  

### OSINT Organizations
_Government and Private based_
**Government Organizations**
1. Open Source Center: controlled by U.S. government  
2. BBC Monitoring (https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/login) is a department within the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) that monitors foreign media worldwide. BBC Monitoring is directed by the BBC and offers its services on a subscription basis to interested parties such as commercial organizations and UK official bodies.
