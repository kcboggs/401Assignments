# Automated AppSec with ZAP
### What is ZAP? 
> "Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is a free, open-source penetration testing tool being maintained under the umbrella of the Open   
Web Application Security Project (OWASP). ZAP is designed specifically for testing web applications and is both flexible and extensible."

### Security Testing Basics
> "Software security testing is the process of assessing and testing a system to discover security risks and vulnerabilities of the system and its data."
* Vulnerability Assessment – The system is scanned and analyzed for security issues.  
* Penetration Testing – The system undergoes analysis and attack from simulated malicious attackers.  
* Runtime Testing – The system undergoes analysis and security testing from an end-user.  
* Code Review – The system code undergoes a detailed review and analysis looking specifically for security vulnerabilities.  

### More About Penetration Testing 
**It is carried out as if the tester was a malicious external attacker with a goal of breaking into the system and either stealing data or carrying out some 
sort of denial-of-service attack.**    

### The Pentesting Process
_Follow these stages_
* Explore – The tester attempts to learn about the system being tested. This includes trying to determine what software is in use, what endpoints exist, what  
patches are installed, etc. It also includes searching the site for hidden content, known vulnerabilities, and other indications of weakness.
* Attack – The tester attempts to exploit the known or suspected vulnerabilities to prove they exist.  
* Report – The tester reports back the results of their testing, including the vulnerabilities, how they exploited them and how difficult the exploits were,  
and the severity of the exploitation.

### Pentesting Goals
**The ultimate goal of pentesting is to search for vulnerabilities so that these vulnerabilities can be addressed.**
