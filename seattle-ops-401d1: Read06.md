# Applying The CIA Triad To Your Enterprise File Transfer

> The CIA Triad refers to three basic principles/objectives in information security, namely: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
It's been proven that, in order to establish a secure system, you need to achieve these three objectives. Let me explain each one first and
why they are crucial to business file transfers."

## Confidentiality
 _Confidentiality refers to the principle of restricting access to or knowledge of certain pieces of information to certain individuals._
 
 
## Integrity
_Pertains to the principle of preventing data from being tampered._

## Availability
_Ensures that information and resources are available to those who need them._

## CIA-Triad-in-One
> "Normally, in order to apply all three elements of the CIA Triad, you would need to employ disparate solutions and integrate them. The problem
with this approach is that it can be quite complex and would therefore require considerable time and expertise before you can come up with a complete
solution. A better option would be to find a single solution that already incorporates all three elements (and possibly more)._
