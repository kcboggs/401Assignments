# What is Mitre's ATT&CK framework? What red teams need to know


### Building an effective red team
* Built your own red-team-style attack tools  
* Hire a managed security service provider (MSSP) or consultant to monitor your network and defenses  
* Assemble a collection of various paid and open source techniques for internal use  

### ATT&CK’s five threat matrices

### ATT&CK undergoing constant improvement
* Combining the various threat matrices into a coherent single document (see graphic below)  
* Hosting ATT&CK on a new wiki platform and making it easier to navigate  
* Developing a new API that can make it easier to interact with ATT&CK using the STIX/TAXII threat sharing schemas  
* Adding better search capabilities  
* Creating a governance committee to decide on future improvements, particularly as more private security vendors begin to offer ATT&CK-based enhancements and tools.  

### Third-party ATT&CK projects
* Mitre has its own testing tool based on ATT&CK called Caldera.    
* Palo Alto Networks’ Unit42 researchers have developed an adversary playbook based on the Mitre ATT&CK and STIX threat schemas.  
* Endgame has developed a Red Team Automation tool that can create scripts for several dozen ATT&CK techniques for testing endpoint detection tools.  
* Red Canary has its Atomic Red project, which contains a series of automated scripts to test many of the ATT&CK techniques.  
* Uber’s Metta project works with Vagrant and Virtual Box to create a series of test scripts for assembling ATT&CK-based playbooks.
