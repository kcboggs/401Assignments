# Setting up Splunk SIEM
### What Is Cybersecurity Automation?
> "Automation allows for faster analysis and, should a host on your network be compromised, faster detection and intervention. ... 
The only way to keep up and defend against these threats efficiently is to employ automation as part of your cybersecurity efforts."
### What Is The Benefit Of Automation?
> "Advantages commonly attributed to automation include higher production rates and increased productivity, more efficient use of 
materials, better product quality, improved safety, shorter workweeks for labour, and reduced factory lead times."
_Once the appropriate activities are automated, cybersecurity practitioners can focus on projects such as:_
* Engineering and Architecture  
* Remediation Activities  
* Automation Development and Engineering  

**Three basic approaches to successfully implement automation concepts include:**
1. Embed development capabilities in your cybersecurity team. In this way, developers report directly to cyber leadership.  
2. Partner cybersecurity with organizational development teams. This allows cybersecurity to leverage the capabilities of organizational development experts.  
3. Adopt a hybrid approach. Utilize an internal team for tactical development work and organizational development capabilities for complex integration tasks.

# Automated Incident Response Explained
### Everything you need to know about automated incident response
> "With the right automated incident response tools, IT security teams can stay in control of their incident response (IR) activities and respond to threats and
intrusions swiftly and effectively, with less manual workâ€”no wire-ripping required."

There are 5 steps to the incident response
1. Preparation. Preparation is the key to effective incident response  
2. Detection and Reporting. The focus of this phase is to monitor security events in order to detect, alert, and report on potential security incidents  
3. Triage and Analysis  
4. Containment and Neutralization
