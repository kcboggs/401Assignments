# Understanding SQL Injection, Identification and Prevention

* Were developed a decade or more ago when some security development practices weren’t as ingrained.  
* Will quite likely crash if you run even an “innocuous” SQL injection attack against them. For instance, you can often grind a database and web server to a halt simply by requesting all of the records in the database instead of the 1 record that the application page would typically load.
