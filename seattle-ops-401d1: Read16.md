# Threat Analysis, Cyber Kill-Chain, and Stuxnet
### BREAKING THE KILL CHAIN: A DEFENSIVE APPROACH
> " First developed by Lockheed Martin, the Cybersecurity Kill Chain is a model for describing the steps an attacker must 
complete to carry a successful attack."

This model is made up of 7 sequential steps, including:  
1. Reconnaissance  
2. Weaponization  
3. Delivery  
4. Exploitation  
5. Installation  
6. Command and Control  
7. Actions on Objectives  

_To disrupt the attack, one or more of these steps must be broken for the entire chain to fail. And in order for us to do that, we need to understand their playbook_

### Reconnaissance
Firstly gather information about the victim
The two different stages of reconnaissance are passive and active

During **Passive** reconnaissance, an attacker will use indirect methods to gather information from publicly available sources like WHOIS, ARIN registrations, Google, Shodan, Job Listings and  company websites.
Once an attacker has collected as much public information as possible, the attacker will move on to **Active** reconnaissance, which involves some level of interaction with your organizations. 



### Weaponization
Once an attacker has found a weakness, their next step is find or create the attack that will exploit the vulnerability
