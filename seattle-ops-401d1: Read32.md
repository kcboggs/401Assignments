### What Is Malware Analysis?
Malware is defined as “a software designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system without the owner’s informed consent.
* It breaks down the malware  
* It investigates its characteristics  
* It unravels its functionality  
* It traces the malware’s origin  
* It tries to predict the impact  

### Malware Analysis Process
_Here’s a more in-depth insight into the malware analysis process:_  
Step 1: Capture the malware  
Step 2: Build a malware lab  
Step 3: Install your tools  
Step 4: Record the baseline  
Step 5: Commence your investigation  
Step 6: Document the results  

### Types of Malware Analysis  
1. Static malware analysis   
2. Dynamic malware analysis   
3. Manual malware analysis   
4. Automated malware analysis   

### Key Stages of Malware Analysis
1. Observing malware behavior   
2. Disassembling the code  
* A disassembler deconstructs the malware into its primitive binary form and reconstructs it into assembly language that’s comprehensible for a human analyst.   
* A debugger conducts a code walkthrough and highlights unusual/suspicious-looking code elements where the malware analyst must investigate further.   
* A decompiler recreates the original source code of a program and can help identify a coder’s digital fingerprint to trace its origin. 
3. Examining the memory
