# Reconnaissance
### What is penetration testing
> " A simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities."

### Penetration testing stages
***Five Stages***
1. Planning and reconnaissance  
The first stage involves:
* Defining the scope and goals of a test, including the systems to be addressed and the testing methods to be used.  
* Gathering intelligence (e.g., network and domain names, mail server) to better understand how a target works and   
its potential vulnerabilities.  

2. Scanning  
This is typically done using:  
* Static analysis – Inspecting an application’s code to estimate the way it behaves while running. These tools can   
scan the entirety of the code in a single pass.  
* Dynamic analysis – Inspecting an application’s code in a running state. This is a more practical way of scanning,   
as it provides a real-time view into an application’s performance.  

3. Gaining Access
This stage uses web application attacks, such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection and backdoors, to uncover a target’s       
vulnerabilities.     
Testers then try and exploit these vulnerabilities, typically by escalating privileges, stealing data, intercepting traffic, etc., to understand the damage they can cause.
