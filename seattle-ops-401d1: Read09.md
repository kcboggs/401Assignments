# PKI - Public Key Infrastructure
> "A technology for authenticating users and devices in the digital world.
A public key infrastructure relies on digital signature technology, which uses
public key cryptography. The basic idea is that the secret key of each entity 
is only known by that entity and is used for signing. This key is called the 
private key. There is another key derived from it, called the public key, which 
is used for verifying signatures but cannot be used to sign. This public key is 
made available to anyone, and is typically included in the certificate document."

# Common Uses of Certificates
### Secure Web Sites - HTTPS
_With HTTPS, certificates serve to identify the web site you are connecting to, 
to ensure that no-one can eavesdrop on your connection_
### Authenticating Users and Computers - SSH
_The Secure Shell protocol supports certificates for authenticating hosts and users._
### Email Signing and Encryption
_Certificates are also used for secure email in corporations._
### Security Limitations of Public Key Infrastructure
_The main weakness of public PKI is that any certificate authority can sign a certificate for any person or computer._
### SSH's Role in the Development of Public Key Infrastructure
_SSH Communications Security was one of the early pioneers in PKI._
