# Threat Modeling with DFDs, STRIDE
### A Beginners Guide To The STRIDE Security Threat Model
> "Threat modeling provides a little preparation that can help you identify blind spots in your application’s security."
**STRIDE framework 6 Areas fo Focus**
* Spoofing  
* Tampering  
* Repudiation  
* Information Disclosure  
* Denial of Service  
* Elevation of Privilege  
### Spoofing
**Common authentication methods for systems and what would be required to spoof a request**  
* Single Key  A sophisticated elevation of privilege attack may use all of the other areas of STRIDE for an especially outsized impact_
### Use STRIDE In Your Work
**Practice**
* Signatures  
### Tampering
_Often, data tampering coincides with other potential threats._
### Repudiation
_You can’t prevent attempted security threats, but you can implement auditing to catch and trace these activities  
secure systems should build in non-repudiation mechanisms_  
### Information Disclosure
> "Along with threats like spoofing, disclosures can be caused by backups and other files left in accessible locations, which  
might include servers, laptops, or external drives. In other circumstances, private data can be inadvertently exposed due to buggy  
code or attacks such as buffer overflows."
### Denial Of Service
_Another security threat from the technical news, a denial of service makes a system unreachable by exploiting resources so they can’t be used for legitimate purposes._
### Elevation Of Privilege
_Elevation of privilege is related to authorization A sophisticated elevation of privilege attack may use all of the other areas of STRIDE for an especially outsized impact_
### Use STRIDE In Your Work
**Practice** makes perfect so when you begin new projects, proactively consider how STRIDE applies.
