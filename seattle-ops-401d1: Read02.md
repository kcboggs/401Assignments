### WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SOC TEAM AND A CSIRT?
"A computer security incident response team or CSIRT, also called CERT or CIRT, is responsible for receiving, analyzing, and responding to 
security incidents. CSIRTs can work under SOCs or can stand alone."

"The core function of a CSIRT is to minimize and manage damage caused by an incident, the CSIRT does not just deal with the attack itself, they also communicate with clients, executives, and the board."

### A SOC team comprises several roles:
