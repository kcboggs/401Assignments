## HOW TO BECOME A SECURITY AUDITOR

> "Security auditors carry a great load of responsibility they need to ensure that a company or governmental agency is safe from criminal and terrorist  
behaviors. Since most businesses and agencies keep the lion's share of their records in digital databases, these must be appropriately protected with   
firewalls, encryption and other security measures.These databases need to be tested periodically to ensure that they comply with the latest IT standards  
and practices." 

## SECURITY AUDITOR VS. PENETRATION TESTER
> "A security auditor seeks to assess a computer system based on established standards and will make recommendations to help the system become compliant."  
A pentester has the job of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities.
