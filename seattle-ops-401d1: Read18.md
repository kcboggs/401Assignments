# Application Threat Modeling
> "Threat modelling works to identify, communicate, and understand threats and mitigations within the context of protecting something of value."
### What
_Most of the time, a threat model includes:_
* A description / design / model of what youâ€™re worried about  
* A list of assumptions that can be checked or challenged in the future as the threat landscape changes  
* A list of potential threats to the system  
* A list of actions to be taken for each threat  
* A way of validating the model and threats, and verification of success of actions taken  
### Why
_The inclusion of threat modelling in the SDLC can help_
* Build a secure design  
* Efficient investment of resources; appropriately prioritize security, development, and other tasks  
* Bring Security and Development together to collaborate on a shared understanding, informing development of the system  
* Identify threats and compliance requirements, and evaluate their risk  
* Define and build required controls    
* Balance risks, controls, and usability  
* Identify where building a control is unnecessary, based on acceptable risk  
* Document threats and mitigation  
* Ensure business requirements (or goals) are adequately protected in the face of a malicious actor, accidents, or other causes of impact  
* Identification of security test cases / security test scenarios to test the security requirements  
### 4 Questions
1. What are we building?  
2. What can go wrong?   
3. What are we going to do about that?  
4. Did we do a good enough job?  
### Process When to Threat Model
_Threat modelling at a whiteboard can be a fluid exchange of ideas between diverse participants._
