# Threat Hunting with ELK Stack
### What is the ELK stack?
> "The ELK stack is an acronym used to describe a stack that comprises of three popular open-source projects: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana."  

**E = Elasticsearch**
Elasticsearch is an open-source, RESTful, distributed search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene. Support for various languages, high performance, and schema-free JSON documents makes Elasticsearch an ideal choice for various log analytics and search use cases.  
**L = Logstash**  
Logstash is an open-source data ingestion tool that allows you to collect data from a variety of sources, transform it, and send it to your desired destination. With pre-built filters and support for over 200 plugins, Logstash allows users to easily ingest data regardless of the data source or type.    
**K = Kibana**
Kibana is an open-source data visualization and exploration tool for reviewing logs and events. Kibana offers easy-to-use, interactive charts, pre-built aggregations and filters, and geospatial support and making it the preferred choice for visualizing data stored in Elasticsearch.

 *** Why is the ELK stack so popular?
 _The ELK Stack is popular because it fulfills a need in the log analytics space._  
 
 ### The ELK stack â€“ Choosing the right option  
You can choose to deploy and manage the ELK stack yourself. But, would you prefer that your developers or DevOps engineers spend time on building innovative applications or on managing operational tasks such as deployment, upgrades, software installation and patching, backups, and monitoring?
