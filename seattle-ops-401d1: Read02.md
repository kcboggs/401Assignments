> "A security operations center (SOC) is traditionally a physical facility with an organization, which houses an information security team."

### WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SOC TEAM AND A CSIRT?
"A computer security incident response team or CSIRT, also called CERT or CIRT, is responsible for receiving, analyzing, and responding to 
security incidents. CSIRTs can work under SOCs or can stand alone."

"The core function of a CSIRT is to minimize and manage damage caused by an incident, the CSIRT does not just deal with the attack itself, they also communicate with clients, executives, and the board."

### A SOC team has two core responsibilities:
* Maintaining security monitoring tools  
* Investigate suspicious activities  

### A SOC team comprises several roles:
* Security analyst  
* Security engineer  
* SOC manager  
* Chief information security officer (CISO)  
* Director of incident response  

_SOC analysts are organized in four tiers_

### Benefits of security operations centers
* Incident response  
* Threat intelligence and rapid analysis  
* Reduce cybersecurity costs  
* Reduce the complexity of investigations  

### Challenges Facing Security Operation Centers
* Increased volumes of security alerts  
* Management of many security tools  
* Resource allocation
